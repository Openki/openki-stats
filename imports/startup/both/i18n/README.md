# i18n
The files in this folder are generated automatically. 
At every start with `meteor npm run dev` the file `en.json` (English) is created by 
`extract-translations`, based on all `i18n(...)` and `{{i18n ...}}` which occur in the code.
All textes in `en.json` get translated by weblate into other languages. Those translation get 
exportet into this folder.
